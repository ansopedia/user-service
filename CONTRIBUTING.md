## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please take a moment to review it to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Contributing

- A **Contributor** is any individual who creates an issue/PR, comments on an issue/PR, or contributes in some other way.
- A **Collaborator** is a contributor with write access to the repository. See [here](#becoming-a-collaborator) on how to become a collaborator.

You can find more details and guides about Collaborating with this repository through our [Collaborator Guide](./COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md).

### Becoming a Collaborator

A collaborator of the Ansopedia and its repository is a member of the Ansopedia Team.

The Platform Team is responsible for the technical development of the Ansopedia; thus, it is expected
that team members have significant knowledge about modern Web Technologies and Web Standards.

Note that regular contributors do not need to become "Collaborators" as any contribution is appreciated (even without a status), and a Collaborator status
is a formality that comes with obligations.

If you're an active contributor seeking to become a member, we recommend you contact one of the existing Team Members for guidance.

<details>
